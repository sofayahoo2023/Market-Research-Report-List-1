<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Type Humidifiers</li><li>Water Spray Humidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial humidifier market includes two primary types: vapor type humidifiers and water spray humidifiers. Vapor type humidifiers work by releasing water vapor into the air, raising humidity levels. They are efficient and are commonly used in large spaces. On the other hand, water spray humidifiers use a nozzle to release mist into the air, thereby increasing humidity. These humidifiers are often used in smaller areas and are relatively less expensive than vapor type humidifiers. Both types contribute to maintaining a comfortable environment by adding moisture to the air.</p></p>
