<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flip Chip Underfills Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capillary Underfill Material (CUF)</li><li>No Flow Underfill Material (NUF)</li><li>Molded Underfill Material (MUF)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flip Chip Underfills Market is segmented into three types - Capillary Underfill Material (CUF), No Flow Underfill Material (NUF), and Molded Underfill Material (MUF). CUF is a low viscosity liquid which fills the gaps between the chip and substrate through capillary action. NUF, on the other hand, is a non-flowable material that does not require capillary action and is mainly used for large die applications. MUF is a pre-molded film or material that is placed between the chip and substrate, providing both electrical and mechanical support.</p></p>
