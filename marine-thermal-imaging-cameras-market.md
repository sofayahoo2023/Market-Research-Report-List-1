<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Thermal Imaging Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled Type</li><li>Cooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Marine thermal imaging cameras can be categorized into two types: uncooled and cooled. Uncooled cameras utilize a microbolometer sensor that does not require cooling. These cameras are cost-effective, compact, and suitable for short-range applications. On the other hand, cooled cameras incorporate a cooled detector to enhance sensitivity and provide high-resolution images for long-range surveillance and tracking purposes. These cameras are more expensive and require maintenance for the cooling system. Both types have their advantages and limitations, and their choice depends on the specific requirements of marine thermal imaging applications.</p></p>
