<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Demagnetization Tunnels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Frequency Demagnetization Tunnels</li><li>Low-Frequency Demagnetization Tunnels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Demagnetization tunnels are used to remove magnetic properties from ferromagnetic materials. High-frequency demagnetization tunnels operate at a rapid frequency, effectively removing magnetism from smaller or thinner objects. On the other hand, low-frequency demagnetization tunnels operate at a slower frequency and are suitable for larger or thicker objects. Both types of tunnels function by exposing the materials to an alternating magnetic field that gradually weakens their magnetism. These market types cater to different industries and applications, depending on the size and thickness of the materials requiring demagnetization.</p></p>
