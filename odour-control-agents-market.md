<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Odour Control Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adsorption Control Agent</li><li>Oxidation Control Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Odour control agents can be categorized into two main types: adsorption control agents and oxidation control agents. Adsorption control agents work by attracting and capturing odor molecules onto their surface, thereby removing them from the surrounding air. On the other hand, oxidation control agents chemically react with odorous compounds, breaking them down into less odorous or non-odorous substances. Both types of control agents are commonly used in various industries and applications to mitigate unpleasant odours and improve overall air quality.</p></p>
