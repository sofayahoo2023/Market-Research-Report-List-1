<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tank Outlet Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Seat</li><li>Double Seat</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tank outlet valves are essential for controlling the flow of liquid out of tanks. Single seat valves have a single sealing surface that prevents leaks when closed, offering reliable and precise control. They are suitable for low to medium-pressure applications. On the other hand, double seat valves feature two sealing surfaces and are designed to handle high-pressure operations with improved sealing performance. They are ideal for applications that require a higher level of control and have more stringent leakage requirements. Both valve types play a crucial role in regulating tank liquid flow, but they differ in terms of pressure compatibility and sealing capabilities.</p></p>
