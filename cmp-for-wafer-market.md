<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP for Wafer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMP Pads</li><li>CMP Slurries</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>CMP, or Chemical Mechanical Planarization, is a key process in semiconductor manufacturing. It involves removing excess material from the surface of a wafer to create a smooth and flat surface. CMP pads are used in this process to apply pressure and distribute slurry evenly on the wafer. CMP slurries consist of a mixture of chemicals and abrasive particles, which aid in material removal. Both CMP pads and slurries play crucial roles in achieving precise planarity, reducing defects, and improving the overall performance of semiconductor devices.</p></p>
