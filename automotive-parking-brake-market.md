<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Parking Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake Type</li><li>Disc Brake Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive parking brake market is divided into two types: drum brake type and disc brake type. In the drum brake type, the brake shoes press against the inner surface of the brake drum, creating friction and stopping the vehicle. This type is commonly found in older vehicles or in the rear wheels of some newer vehicles. On the other hand, the disc brake type applies friction by forcing brake pads against a rotor, resulting in better heat dissipation and improved stopping power. This type is commonly used in modern vehicles.</p></p>
