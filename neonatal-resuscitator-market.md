<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Resuscitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Resuscitator</li><li>Automatic Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Neonatal Resuscitator market consists of two types: Manual Resuscitator and Automatic Resuscitator. A Manual Resuscitator is a handheld device commonly used by medical professionals to manually deliver breaths to neonates who are unable to breathe on their own. It requires the caregiver to squeeze a bag to deliver the necessary breaths. On the other hand, an Automatic Resuscitator is a device that automatically delivers breaths to neonates in need, eliminating the need for manual squeezing. Both types play a vital role in providing respiratory support to newborns in critical situations.</p></p>
