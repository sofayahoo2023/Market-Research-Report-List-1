<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specimen Retrieval Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detachable</li><li>Non-detachable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Specimen retrieval systems are used during minimally invasive surgeries to retrieve tissue or organ samples. There are two types of specimen retrieval systems: detachable and non-detachable. Detachable systems allow for the specimen to be detached from the retrieval bag or pouch after it is collected, making it easier to retrieve multiple specimens and reduce the risk of contamination. Non-detachable systems, on the other hand, keep the specimen attached to the retrieval bag, preventing any contact with the surgical site and minimizing the chance of infection. Both types have their advantages based on the specific surgical procedure and the surgeon's preference.</p></p>
