<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic or Autonomous Emergency Braking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Collision Warning</li><li>Dynamic Brake Support</li><li>Crash Imminent Braking</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automatic/emergency braking market types consist of three major components: forward collision warning, dynamic brake support, and crash imminent braking. Forward collision warning systems use sensors to detect potential collisions with objects or vehicles ahead, alerting the driver to take action. Dynamic brake support systems provide additional braking force if the driver doesn't apply enough pressure during an emergency. Crash imminent braking systems automatically apply the brakes if a collision is imminent and the driver fails to take any action, helping to minimize the severity of the impact.</p></p>
