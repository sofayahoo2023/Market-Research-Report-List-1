<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spherical Lens</li><li>Aspherical Lens</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-end intraocular lens market consists of two main types: spherical lenses and aspherical lenses. Spherical lenses have a uniform curvature across their surface, providing clear vision for individuals with common refractive errors such as nearsightedness or farsightedness. On the other hand, aspherical lenses have a more complex surface curvature, improving overall visual quality by reducing spherical aberrations, resulting in sharper and clearer vision. Both spherical and aspherical lenses play a crucial role in the high-end intraocular lens market, catering to different visual needs and preferences of patients.</p></p>
