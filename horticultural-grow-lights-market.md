<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horticultural Grow Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Toplighting</li><li>Interlighting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The horticultural grow lights market encompasses different types, including toplighting and interlighting. Toplighting refers to the method of providing artificial light from above the plants, replicating natural sunlight and promoting growth. It is commonly used in greenhouse cultivation. On the other hand, interlighting involves placing lights within the plants, aiming to optimize light absorption in the lower canopy and enhance overall production. This technique is particularly beneficial for crops with dense foliage. Both toplighting and interlighting offer effective lighting solutions for horticultural purposes, supporting plant growth and crop yield.</p></p>
