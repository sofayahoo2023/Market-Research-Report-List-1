<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Cutting Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hub Dicing Blades</li><li>Hubless Dicing Blades</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wafer cutting blades market comprises two main types: hub dicing blades and hubless dicing blades. Hub dicing blades are equipped with a metal hub that holds the blade in place during cutting. They offer a higher level of stability and precision, making them suitable for delicate and high-precision cutting applications. On the other hand, hubless dicing blades lack a metal hub, which allows for greater cutting depth and improved cooling. They are commonly used for cutting thicker wafers and materials that require high-speed and heavy-duty cutting.</p></p>
