<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Personal Rapid Transit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vehicle Switching</li><li>Track Switching</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Two types of market systems exist in the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) industry, which are Vehicle Switching and Track Switching. In a Vehicle Switching system, passengers remain in the same cabin throughout their journey, but the vehicle they are in switches tracks at junctions to reach their desired destination. Conversely, in a Track Switching system, passengers switch cabins at junctions while their original cabin follows a separate track to transport other passengers. These systems allow for efficient transportation by optimizing pathways and minimizing congestion.</p></p>
