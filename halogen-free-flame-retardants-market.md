<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Halogen-Free Flame Retardants are chemicals used to enhance the fire resistance of various materials without the use of halogen compounds, which are potentially harmful to the environment. The market is segmented into three types: Aluminum Hydroxide, Organo-Phosphorus, and Other. </p><p>Aluminum Hydroxide flame retardants work by releasing water vapor upon exposure to heat, thus cooling the material and extinguishing the fire. Organo-Phosphorus flame retardants function by forming a protective layer on the material's surface, which hinders the flame propagation. The Other category comprises various non-halogenated flame retardants like boron compounds and nitrogen-based products. All these options offer effective fire resistance while minimizing the ecological impact associated with halogen compounds.</p></p>
