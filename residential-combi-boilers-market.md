<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Combi Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Residential Combi Boilers are classified into two types: Non-condensing Boilers and Condensing Boilers. Non-condensing Boilers are the traditional type that operate at high temperatures and have larger dimensions. They are less efficient as they waste heat through the flue. On the other hand, Condensing Boilers are more energy-efficient as they recover heat from the flue gases, reducing energy consumption and emissions. They are smaller in size and operate at lower temperatures. This makes Condensing Boilers the preferred choice for residential use due to their environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
