<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Therapy Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tap Water</li><li>Pure Water</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Heat therapy pumps are medical devices used to provide hot water therapy for pain relief and healing. Tap water heat therapy pumps use ordinary tap water to deliver temperature-controlled heat for reducing muscle pain and inflammation. On the other hand, pure water heat therapy pumps use purified water to avoid any potential impurities in the water, providing a more sterile and controlled heat therapy experience. Both types of pumps are effective in managing pain and promoting healing, but pure water pumps are often preferred in medical settings where sterility is crucial.</p></p>
