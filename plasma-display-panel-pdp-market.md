<p><h1>Global Plasma Display Panel (PDP) Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>A Plasma Display Panel (PDP) is a type of flat-panel display technology that uses small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases to produce an image. Each cell consists of three color subcells (red, green, and blue) that emit ultraviolet light when stimulated by electrical current. These ultraviolet light rays then strike phosphors on the screen, producing visible light and creating the desired image.</p><p>The PDP market has experienced significant growth over the years, primarily driven by the increasing demand for high-resolution displays in various applications such as televisions, digital signage, and monitors. However, with the emergence of LED and OLED technologies, PDP displays have started to lose their market share.</p><p>Despite the decline in popularity, the PDP market still holds potential opportunities. PDP displays offer advantages like wider viewing angles, high contrast ratios, and faster response times compared to conventional LCD displays. These features make them suitable for specific applications such as large-sized televisions and outdoor signage.</p><p>Additionally, technological advancements are being made to improve the energy efficiency and lifespan of PDP displays, which can help maintain their market presence. Efforts to reduce power consumption and enhance screen resolution are also ongoing.</p><p>According to the provided information, the PDP market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4% during the forecasted period. This growth can be attributed to the demand for large-sized displays and the advancement in PDP technology. However, it is important to note that the competition from LED and OLED technologies might limit the overall growth potential of the PDP market in the future.</p></p>

<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>Panasonic Corporation, a leading Japanese multinational electronics company, has a strong presence in the Plasma Display Panel (PDP) market. With a history dating back to 1918, Panasonic has established itself as a renowned brand in the global consumer electronics industry. In the early 2000s, Panasonic became a dominant player in the PDP market due to its technological advancements and superior picture quality. However, with the rise of LCD and LED displays, Panasonic discontinued its PDP production in 2014. Despite this, Panasonic remains a key player in the overall consumer electronics market and has diversified its product offerings to meet changing consumer preferences.</p><p>Samsung Electronics, based in South Korea, is another major player in the PDP market. Samsung is known for its innovative display technologies and has made significant contributions to the advancement of PDPs. Over the years, Samsung has been successful in expanding its market share in the global consumer electronics industry. However, similar to Panasonic, Samsung discontinued its PDP production in 2010, shifting its focus towards LCD and LED displays.</p><p>LG Electronics, a Korean multinational electronics company, is renowned for manufacturing a wide range of consumer electronics, including PDPs. LG has been a dominant player in the PDP market and has gained recognition for its high-quality displays. However, with the declining demand for PDPs, LG ceased PDP production in 2014 and diversified its portfolio to focus on OLED and LED displays instead.</p><p>Changhong Electric, a Chinese consumer electronics company, also ventured into the PDP market. Changhong was initially known for producing CRT televisions but later diversified into manufacturing PDPs. Changhong experienced steady growth in the PDP market, particularly in the domestic market of China, due to its competitive pricing and superior display quality. However, with the declining popularity of PDPs globally, Changhong shifted its focus to LCD and LED displays.</p><p>Unfortunately, specific sales revenue data for the mentioned companies in the PDP market is not readily available. However, it is important to note that the PDP market faced declining demand in the late 2000s due to the emergence of LCD and LED technologies. This led to decreased market size and ultimately the discontinuation of PDP production by major players such as Panasonic, Samsung, and LG. Hitachi, a Japanese company, also discontinued its PDP production but continues to operate in the consumer electronics market. Pioneer, another player in the PDP market, was acquired by Panasonic in 2014 to strengthen its presence and technology portfolio.</p></p>
