<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning Process</li><li>Dry Spinning Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide Fibre is a type of synthetic fiber known for its high heat resistance, excellent mechanical properties, and chemical stability. It is produced through two main processes: wet spinning and dry spinning. </p><p>Wet spinning involves dissolving the polyimide in a solvent, extruding it through spinnerets, and then coagulating it in a liquid bath. This process allows for the production of strong, flexible fibers.</p><p>Dry spinning, on the other hand, involves dissolving the polyimide in a volatile solvent, extruding it through spinnerets, and then evaporating the solvent in a controlled chamber. This process yields fibers with high tensile strength and improved dimensional stability.</p><p>Both wet spinning and dry spinning methods contribute to the diverse application of polyimide fibers in industries such as aerospace, electronics, and automotive.</p></p>
