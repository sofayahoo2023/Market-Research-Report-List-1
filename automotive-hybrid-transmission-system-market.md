<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Hybrid Transmission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Multi Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive hybrid transmission system market can be classified into two types: single stage and multi-stage. In a single stage system, there is only one gear set that combines the functions of both the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. This type of system is simple and more cost-effective. On the other hand, a multi-stage system consists of multiple gear sets, allowing for more precise control of power distribution between the engine and the motor. This type of system offers better efficiency and performance but tends to be more complex and expensive.</p></p>
