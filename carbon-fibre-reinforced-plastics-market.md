<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting CRFP</li><li>Thermoplastic CRFP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) are composite materials that consist of carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. There are two main types of CFRP based on the type of polymer matrix used: thermosetting CFRP and thermoplastic CFRP. Thermosetting CFRP is made by curing a liquid resin, resulting in a rigid and durable material. On the other hand, thermoplastic CFRP is composed of a polymer that can be melted and reformed multiple times, providing flexibility and recyclability. Both types of CFRP are widely used in various industries due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance.</p></p>
