<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Curing Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radical Type</li><li>Cationic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy curing resins are used in various industries for efficient and quick curing of coatings, inks, adhesives, and composites. There are two types of energy curing resins, namely radical type and cationic type. Radical type resins cure when exposed to UV light, initiating a photoinitiator-driven radical polymerization process. Cationic type resins, on the other hand, cure when exposed to UV or electron beam radiation, which initiates a cationic polymerization process. Both these types offer fast curing, improved productivity, excellent performance, and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
