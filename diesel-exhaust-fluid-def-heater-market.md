<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Heater</li><li>Oval Heater</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Heater market has two main types: the straight heater and the oval heater. A straight heater is a linear heating device that is designed to evenly distribute heat to the DEF tank. It is typically used in tanks that have a narrow space for installation. On the other hand, an oval heater is shaped like an oval and is used in tanks with a larger surface area. It provides efficient heating by covering a larger area of the DEF tank. Both types of heaters play a crucial role in maintaining the proper temperature of DEF in diesel vehicles.</p></p>
