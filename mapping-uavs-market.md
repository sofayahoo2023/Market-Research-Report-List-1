<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mapping UAVs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Airfoil</li><li>Fixed-Wing</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mapping UAVs are classified into three main market types: rotary airfoil, fixed-wing, and others. Rotary airfoil UAVs are equipped with rotating wings, also known as rotors, which enable vertical take-off and landing capabilities, making them ideal for maneuvering in tight spaces. Fixed-wing UAVs, on the other hand, resemble miniature airplanes and are designed for longer flight durations, higher speeds, and larger coverage areas. The "others" category encompasses unconventional mapping UAV designs, such as multi-rotor hybrid systems or unique configurations that do not fit into the previous two categories.</p></p>
