<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lubricant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-synthetic Lubricant</li><li>Synthetic Lubricant</li><li>Mineral Lubricant</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The lubricant market can be divided into three main types: semi-synthetic lubricants, synthetic lubricants, and mineral lubricants. Semi-synthetic lubricants are a blend of mineral and synthetic oils, providing better performance and protection than mineral lubricants. Synthetic lubricants are entirely man-made, offering superior lubrication and stability under extreme conditions. They are often used in high-performance engines. Mineral lubricants, on the other hand, are derived from refined crude oil and are more cost-effective but generally offer lower performance compared to semi-synthetic or synthetic lubricants.</p></p>
