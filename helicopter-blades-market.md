<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Rotor</li><li>Tail Rotor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The helicopter blades market can be categorized into two main types: main rotor blades and tail rotor blades. Main rotor blades are the larger blades located on top of the helicopter, responsible for generating the lift needed for the helicopter to hover and move vertically. They are essential for controlling the helicopter's altitude and movement in all directions. On the other hand, tail rotor blades are smaller blades located at the tail of the helicopter, which provide anti-torque and stabilize the aircraft by countering the torque produced by the main rotor's rotation.</p></p>
